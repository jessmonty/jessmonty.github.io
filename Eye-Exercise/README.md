# Eye-Exercise
## This is a fun exercise wherein the user's mouse movement is tracked and the eyes created on the screen follow that movement.
## In order to run this on your own machine, download all the files and drag and drop the html file into your browser.
## It would be fun to add an image of a line for a mouth which could change to a black oval when the mouse hovered over it like you were feeding it.

# PacMen-Exercise
## In this exercise, we created two buttons: one called "Add PacMan" to create PacMen images in random positions around the page, and another called "Start Game" which caused the PacMen images to each move in its own random direction at random velocities. Each PacMan would hit the page boundaries and bounce back into another random direction and so on.
## In order to run this on your machine, download the files and drag and drop the html file into your browser. Enjoy!
## Improvements I could make to this is changing the images of PacMan each time they hit the boundaries to look as if they were turning around.

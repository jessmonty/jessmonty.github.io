# Jessi Montgomery's Professional Portfolio

## This repository is where I'll present all of my coding projects and abilities for potential employers and others who are interested.

## If you have any questions or are in need of help, you can contact me through my email.

## My plans for this portfolio is to be a clean, user friendly, interactive page wherein one can access my projects and get to know a little about me.

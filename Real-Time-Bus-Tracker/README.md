# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## This project gives a real-time marker on a map showing where the bus on a specific route is currently located. I added some zoom buttons in order for the user to be able to control the view.
## In order to run this program on your machine download the three files (.html, .js, .css) and drag and drop the html file into your browser window.
## I would like to change the markers to be more customized and unique as well as creating the ability to toggle between different views (satellite, normal, dark mode).
